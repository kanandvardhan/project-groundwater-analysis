Iam Sai Anand I will be explaining how we made a digital structure using staad pro


So for the project we have built a G+3 RCC Building


so how did we do it,


After we enter the designing platform window where we see white space


First we are going to place nodes at required geometry then we connect beams 
to this nodes using respective cursors


here translational repeat is an option where we can repeat the selected parts of the 
structure required no.of times thats how we easily built to G+3 floors also we can do
required no.of floors



Assigning supports, properties and material according to our IS 456 are the next steps to be done


Applying loads to the structure


and finally putting the given inputs and information to the analyzation


then we finally be getting results of how well the structure is built also we can say
that we successfully built this by looking at the report with 0 errors, 0 warnings 



these are the specifications of the structure


here we can see the 3d rendered view , beam displacement , bmd , sfd of the structure


these are the details of a random beam and column
where we can know how the c/s is and how many no.of steel bars and their placement is

staad pro also gives the amount of material to be used and the total steel required.


thats all from my side,
srinivas will be concluding this presentation.
